# TT2-Raspberry-Backend

Code used from a Raspberry pi to control the different modules of my final universityâ€™s project.
My thesis can be found here (coming soon, waiting for my university to publish it), detailing all parts of the project and its functionality.
The Android/web app used to control the project can be found [here.](https://github.com/RodoPZ/TT2-App)
